Effort is the combination of pleasure and pain. But don't get me wrong, pain is not the object of pleasure, but rather the obstacle to surpassing oneself, and therefore to personal accomplishment or progress. It's with this philosophy that I'm able to motivate myself to continue doing something.<br>
 I enjoy road cycling and running. Cycling is all about adrenalin, speed and danger. Running gives you a feeling of security and comfort, you're alone in your own bubble, it's a kind of therapy. During the effort, you need to hold on to something in your head to sustain the effort. <br>
Moreover, endurance is linked to the mind, and often in a marathon it's the mind that fails before the rest, even for the most highly trained. <br>
Whoever you are, wherever you're from, get moving, put yourself in motion. It's with this state of mind that you'll accomplish things you never thought possible.<br>
